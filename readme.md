Wifi Manual Control
=====================

The Wifi Manual Control (Wmc) is project to control locomtives with digital controls which supports the Z21 protocol of Roco. 
The design is made up of a NodeMcu with an ESP8266-12E processor, 1.44 inch display, roatry switch and some push buttons. 
The code itself is a mess at the moment, the switch case state machine for example needs to be replaced with a better state machine implementaion.
