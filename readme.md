Wifi Manual Control
=====================

The Wifi Manual Control (Wmc) is a project which supports the [Z21 protocol](https://www.z21.eu/en) of [Roco](https://www.roco.cc/en/home/index.html) to control locomotives and turnouts. Also CV's can be read and written. 
The design is based on an ESP8266-12E processor (Wemos Mini D1 for example), an ST7735 1.44 inch display, rotary (pulse) switch and some push buttons.
